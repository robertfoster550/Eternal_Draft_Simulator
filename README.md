Eternal Draft Simulator
by: Robert Foster (aka: Xi550, astroknitter)

This program is intended to simulate a draft for the game Eternal. It is not affiliated with Eternal or Dire Wolf Digital in any way. This is just a fan-made project, intended for use by the community. All assets from Eternal are property of Dire Wolf Digital. All copyrighted material, images, and ideas belong to Dire Wolf Digital. This simulator is in no way intended to compete with the original game, and is simply a way to express love for the game, to provide a place to practice, and to spread awareness of the original. If you have never played Eternal, download it and play it! It is a great game. Visit https://www.direwolfdigital.com/eternal/ for more information.

The images and JSON files used as the basis of the drafter are taken from Eternal Warcry; https://eternalwarcry.com/. Please visit and use this website, as it is great, though also .

The card ratings used are from Farming Eternal; http://farmingeternal.azurewebsites.net/. This is a great podcast and community. The ratings themselves are taken from Ben's metrics. Thank you all very much!



### Version 0.1 ###

Currently it is just a Python code (or corresponding Jupyter Notebook code). To use, download the files, and run the code (or the notebook). There are a few packages that are required to run it, but most are not unusual, so hopefully it isn't too difficult to use. I'm brand new to coding for other's use, so let me know if there is something I really shouldn't do. Feel free to provide feedback on GitHub or anywhere else you can reach me.
