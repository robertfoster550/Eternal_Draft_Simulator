This program is intended to simulate a draft for the game Eternal. It is not affiliated with Eternal or Dire Wolf Digital in any way. This is just a fan-made project, intended for use by the community. All assets from Eternal are property of Dire Wolf Digital. All copyrighted material, images, and ideas belong to Dire Wolf Digital. This simulator is in no way intended to compete with the original game, and is simply a way to express love for the game, to provide a place to practice, and to spread awareness of the original. If you have never played Eternal, download it and play it! It is a great game. Visit https://www.direwolfdigital.com/eternal/ for more information.

The images and JSON files used as the basis of the drafter are taken from Eternal Warcry; https://eternalwarcry.com/. Please visit and use this website, as it is great, though also .

The card ratings used are from Farming Eternal; http://farmingeternal.azurewebsites.net/. This is a great podcast and community. The ratings themselves are taken from Ben's metrics. Thank you all very much!

### Version 0.1 ###

Currently it is just a Python code (or corresponding Jupyter Notebook code). To use, download the files, and run the code (or the notebook). There are a few packages that are required to run it, but most are not unusual, so hopefully it isn't too difficult to use. I'm brand new to coding for other's use, so let me know if there is something I really shouldn't do.

### Version 1.0 ###

There is now a basic GUI in place, and a Windows executable. To use it, simply download and extract all of the files, then find the application called "Draft Simulator" and double-click. That will run the program. Currently, the bots do not have much information about the format, as it runs the Set 6 - Flames of Xulta draft, which currently is new. So, the bots are a bit dumb, but they still work; usually taking the rare in the pack and then sticking to the first two colors they get into. This will be improved soon.

### Version 1.1 ###

Moved 'Start Draft' button to center of the screen.
Made the stats slightly smaller.
Made the deck list slightly larger.
Added the 'Cost Curve' to the drafting screen.
Added progress bar to the drafting screen.
Added 'Settings', saving and resetting; more options comming soon.
All of Set 7 has been added, but we don't have the Draft Pack contents yet, so the default format is still 6c.
